Created lexer and parser for code generation language.

A lexer is a software program that performs lexical analysis. Lexical analysis is the process of separating a stream of characters into
different words, which in computer science we call 'tokens' .

A parser is a compiler or interpreter component that breaks data into smaller elements for easy translation into another language. 
A parser takes input in the form of a sequence of tokens or program instructions and usually builds a data structure in the form of 
a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree.
